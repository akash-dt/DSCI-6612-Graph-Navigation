# DSCI-6612-Graph-Navigation 
Course Project for DSCI-6612 Intro to Artificial Intelligence

Introduction: 
The project will implement the A* algorithm, a widely used and efficient graph search algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The A* algorithm enhances Dijkstra's algorithm by incorporating a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal node more efficiently. The heuristic function provides an estimate of the remaining distance from each node to the goal node, allowing the algorithm to prioritize nodes that are likely to be closer to the goal.
For these projects, we have used pedestrian paths around and inside our campus [University of New Haven, CT, USA] any location can be used just by defining the name of the place. The code is a jupyter notebook file consisting of all steps implemented in series.
